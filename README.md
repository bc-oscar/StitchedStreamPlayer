====================

Sample Code from Apple that demos how to play a video in the AVPlayer, specifically demonstrates how to read timedMetadata from the HLS stream.  Creating this repo to bring it up to date since Apple has not updated it since 2011 plus adding some other sample code related to the AVPlayer itself.
